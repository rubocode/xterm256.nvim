xterm-256color palette and colorscheme creation for nvim with lua

This colorscheme was inspired by the two-firewatch colorscheme on an apple terminal.
I wanted the exact same colors on a truecolor terminal such as WezTerm and others.
Portability was gained by the adding the constraint of sticking to the xterm256 color palette.

I ended up learning LUA just so that I can get this working.
I have created a design structure that is more intuitive for experimenting with the color palette.
